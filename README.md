# Rocky Framework
Rocky is a [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org) framework aimed at simplifying the process of building powerful APIs in your [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com) agent. It allows you to specify callback handlers for specific routes (verb + path), for events such as unhandled errors, and do some other useful things like build authentication and timeouts into your API. Think of it a bit like Nodeâ€™s [Express](http://expressjs.com), only for Squirrel.

# Usage

## Rocky()
Create a Rocky application:

	class Rocky { ... }
	
	app <- Rocky();
	
	app.get("/", function(context) {
		context.send("Hello World!");
	});

## Application

## Settings
The following settings can be passed into Rocky to alter how it behaves:

- ```timeout``` - Modifies how long Rocky will hold onto a request before automatically executing the onTimeout handler
- ```allowUnsecure``` - Modifies whether or not Rocky will accept HTTP requests (as opposed to HTTPS)
- ```strictRouting``` - Enables or disables strict routing - by default Rocky will consider "/foo" and "/foo/" 	as identical paths
- ```accessControl``` - Modifies whether or not Rocky will automatically add Access-Control headers to the response object. 

The default settings are listed below:

	{ 
		timeout = 10,
		allowUnsecure = false,
		strictRouting = false,
		accessControl = true
	}
	
## app.VERB(path, callback)
The ```app.VERB``` methods provide the basic routing functionality in Rocky. The following verbs are available: **get**, **put**, **post**.


The following snippet illustrates the simplest route handler possible. 

	app.get("/", function(context) {
		context.send("Hello World");
	});
	
Regular expressions may also be used in the path. If you wanted to respond to both /color and /colour you could create the following handler:

	app.get("/colo[u]?r", function(context) {
		context.send(200, { color = led.color });
	});
