# Rocky Framework
Rocky is a [Squirrel](http://squirrel-lang.org) framework aimed at simplifying the process of building powerful APIs in your [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com) agent. It allows you to specify callback handlers for specific routes (verb + path), for events such as unhandled errors, and do some other useful things like build authentication and timeouts into your API. Think of it a bit like Nodeâ€™s [Express](http://expressjs.com), only for Squirrel.
